# Introduction 
Hi , this project is a part of the ENE311: Fundamentals of Electronic Product Design course at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT).

 In this class, we’re not just building circuits — we’re engineering solutions. This Buck Converter PCB design demonstrates the integration of power electronics, embedded systems, and real-world design constraints. From component selection and schematic capture to layout optimization and thermal considerations, every step of this project reflects a hands-on journey toward becoming a professional hardware designer.

This isn’t just a class assignment. It’s a showcase of what the next generation of engineers can create — with precision, creativity, and purpose.
